## Rules of the game

**Rule 1**:  The board is arranged in a grid based system while tetrominoes fall towards the bottom of the board.

**Rule 2**:  Players must arrange tetrominoes in such a way as to create one solid line of filled spaces from the left bound to the right to get 5 points.

**Rule 3**:  Reach 60 points before the tetrominoes stack to the top of the screen or lose the game.

## How to play

**Step 1**: After pressing start a tetromino will begin falling and a previewed tetromino will appear above the board.

**Step 2**: Players must use the left and right arrow keys to position the tetromino horizontally

**Step 3**: Players must press the spacebar in order to rotate the tetromino clockwise.

**Step 4**: Continue this process to align the tetrominoes and fill all available spaces horizontally.

**Step 4**: Once a line has been created horizontally, that line will disappear and the tetrominoes will fall down one level.

**Step 5**: The game will either declare a winner at 60 points or end the game if the tetrominoes stack to the top of the screen.
